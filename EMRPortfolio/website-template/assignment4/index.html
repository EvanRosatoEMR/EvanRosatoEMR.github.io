			but none of them could make it all the way to the top. Then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, someone made it. They climbed atop the piles of frozen corpses that littered
			the mountain's paths, and stared down. The climber could no longer see the tiny town he once called home. When the climber returned to tell their story, nobody listened to them.
			Now that the mountain was stained with victory, nobody wanted to hear about it. The End.</p>
