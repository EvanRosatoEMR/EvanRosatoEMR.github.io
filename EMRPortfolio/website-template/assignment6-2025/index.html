				<p>As a college student without a stable income, going back and forth halfway across the country every semester, 
				it’s been hard for me to find a job that sticks for more than a few months. Blemishes on my resume that I think about whenever I try to apply for work. 
				I’ve had to rely on my parent’s money and tax refund checks from the school for this semester, as I got a job quite late last summer.</p>
				
				<div class = "parallax" id = "bg2"></div>
				
				<p>I know that I’m not the only one struggling for work. Even for just 1 of the few jobs I’d need in order to afford housing in the future, 
				it hasn’t been easy. I don’t feel like I’m learning many of the necessary skills in order to land a job in my field, even from this class. 
				I feel like my knowledge of Web Development hasn’t progressed much since High School, forcing me to work in other fields to raise money, 
				thus decreasing my time to actually hone the skills I’m going to school for.</p>
