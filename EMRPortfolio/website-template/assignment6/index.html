				<h1>THEY SAY,</h1>

				<p><em>We find the phrase in Job 1:21, after Job—a man described as blameless and upright, who loved God, 
				shunned evil and was the greatest among all the people of the East (vv. 1-2)—lost his 10 children, thousands of livestock, and countless servants in a single day. 
				This came some time after God and Satan were said to have argued over Job’s character. God described Job as God-fearing, 
				but the devil said Job was only so fearful and righteous because all had gone well for him. God then granted the devil power over all Job had, 
				though He said the devil could not hurt the man himself (v. 12).
				
				When the cursed day arrived and Job did indeed lose everything, he was devastated. He tore his robe, shaved his head, and worshipped God, crying, 
				“Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised” (Job 1:21).</em></p>
				
				<p><em>While at first Job praises this sovereign God who gives and takes away, later more destruction occurs. 
				He is plagued with painful sores, and his wife and friends begin to falsely accuse him of bringing these sorrows upon himself—perhaps his sin prompted God’s retribution.

				Soon, Job sinks into a depressive state. His view of God as one who would arbitrarily give and take away translates into despair. 
				He sees it as an abuse of power, this God who destroys at will, seemingly for the fun of it. 
				He moves away from God, and begins to see God as an enemy unworthy, perhaps, of his adoration.

				As he finally utters in Job 30:20-22, “I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me. 
				You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me. You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.”

				But ultimately, Job repents of this perspective. He understands he cannot define God as cruel or arbitrary. He cannot even say, “The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away” (Job 3:21).

				As he reflects in Job 42:3-6, “You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’ 
				Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. 
				You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.’ 
				My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.’”
				</em></p>
				
				<p><em>God does indeed have a plan for the world. He has a purpose and a will. 
				And on one hand, God Almighty, who is all-knowing and all-encompassing, is indeed sovereign over everything. 
				But not everything that happens is God’s will. For instance, God does not want us to sin, yet we do. 
				In the case of Job, God was clearly delighted with Job, but while He didn’t cause the calamity to happen, He did allow the devil to do as he wished in the man’s life.

				We cannot understand the ways of God, as Job ultimately concludes. But we do know God orchestrates all according to His ultimate purpose, no matter what.

				<p>The acceptance of oppression underneath an authority figure under the guise of a greater purpose for the betterment of yourself and your people
				is a tool that humans have used to justify subjugation of other groups of people for centuries. The story of Job illustrates just how far back this line of thinking has spanned.</p>
				
				<p>Job questioning God for all the sorrow he has been bestowed, for reasons beyond his knowledge, is no different than any common man questioning the treatment he is bestowed by anyone above him.
				It is no different than the worker questioning the boss of their newfound unemployment. It is no different than the child questioning the parent of their cruelty or neglect.</p>
				
				<p>Should God truly be all-knowing; Understanding the suffering he has allowed Satan to bring unto this man, who by all accounts would be innocent under any examination,
				then the only difference between the previous examples is that God has no excuse. God is not infallible to the feelings of man as any man is. God is not powerless to aide this man as many men are.
				God simply hides behind is Plan. His promises of something greater. Something out of our reach or understanding, both of which he also controls.</p>
				
				<p>Acceptance of this position simply because we cannot know the purpose of this treatment is the acceptance of cruelty. The acceptance of powerlessness.
				Truly, if we all have a piece of God inside of us; the Holy Spirit lingering, coursing through our being, then should we not be aware of it?</p>
				
				<p>Should we not acknowledge that at our core, there is little difference between God and Man? Just as Man cannot truly know the feelings of God,
				Man cannot truly know the feelings of other men. If God is truly capable of knowing what Man feels, why does he persist in this treatment?</p>
				
				<p>Unlike other men who may be complacent in not answering this question, I intend to seek it to it's end. To discover the true purpose behind the sliver of God's spirit
				bestowed to me.</p>
				
				<p>God has given.</p>
