					<p style = "text-align: center"><em>"No, I don't know how I lived so long. Please stop asking."</em> -Splagitowitz's Last Words.
					
					Percy Splagitowitz was a kind, caring husband and father of 27.
					
					He founded Healio at just 15 years old. Originally, the company made candlesticks.
					
					<em>”When I was little, I used to be too scared to sleep in the dark.
					My dear sweet mother, God rest her soul, would light a candle beside my bed to help me rest.
					It made the sounds of loose muskets and howling wolves outside a lot more bearable.
					I think that's why I wanted to make candles, at first. To spread that feeling of comfort.
					I wantws to make something that glows brighter than the sun,
					something that makes people feel as safe as the daylight.”</em>
					-Percy Splagitowitz, 1919</p>
