		<h1>Short Response about that AI article</h1>
		<h2>By Evan Rosato (1/31/2025)</h2>

		<p><em>Imagine with me, if you will, a scenario you're almost certainly familiar with.</em> It's dinner time, and you and some friends want to go out to eat.
		You're going over some of the restaurants nearby and gauging your friends' reactions. Everyone is cooperative, but every time you get close to making a decision,
		on of your friends pipes up. They say that whatever place you were so close to finally going to is off the table. Why? Well, maybe it's because there's nothing
		they like there. Maybe it's because it's too far away. Maybe it's even because that placed wronged them in some way, or has bad business practices they don't want to support.
		All perfectly valid reasons not to go... but then, whenever you try and ask them what they ARE in the mood for, so a conclusion can finally be reached and so EVERYONE can do eat,
		they throw up their hands, and say, <em>"I don't know."</em> That's what articles like this always remind me of.</p>
		
		<p>Partly because, none of what this man is going over is new information. Most of it is actually pretty OLD information at this point. We KNOW that A.I. is taking over creative roles
		on the web and putting hundreds of people out of work. We KNOW that A.I. is progressing at an alarmingly fast and unprecedented rate that makes it impossible to keep up with.
		We KNOW that it's taking away what little social interaction and privacy we still have online. NONE of this is new, and if you're somehow just learning about this now, then
		there are a hundred different places you can learn it from. What bugs me about all this gloom and doom talk isn't that the fears behind it are unfounded or invalid.
		It's that rarely do I ever see anyone even ATTEMPT to offer any solutions to the issues.
		</p>
		
		<p>I think what's happened is that people have gotten so used to the status quo being so awful and everything always getting worse, nothing ever happening, that the
		mere thought of change doesn't even apply to a lot of people any more. All we can do is "Hope things change" in some non-specific way that answers all of our problems.
		And while we wait for that day to come, we'll isolate ourselves from anything that makes us even remotely uncomfortable. That's why I hate reading articles like this,
		especially for assignments. I'm not learning anything new. All I'm learning is how much articles like these piss me off.
		</p>
		
		<p>It'd be pretty hypocritical of me to say all this and not offer a solution of my own, however. At least to the issue I've brought up about these articles.
		Personally, I think we all just need to... get off social media. The constant stream of shitty news after shitty news would make anyone burnt out. The only people
		who aren't are the ones profitting from it in some way. I know why people stay, especially when things change as fast as they are, but it's for your own good.
		Take some time to collect your thoughts, talk to other people around you about what they think and how it's affecting them... like, DIRECTLY talk to them.
		Then, see if you can actually offer some sort of hope to others, instead of just repeating the same shit they've heard a dozen times this past week alone.</p>
